### Group Reflection - Milestone 4

This week went very smoothly. We have learned from our previous mistakes and iterated to have a better workflow. We noted a few noticeable improvements. Firstly, we have become more comfortable with proper git workflow, including pull requests, merging, and reviewing. In the past we were sidetracked with some git issues. Now, with some more experience under our belts, we were able to have a very smooth git workflow. When git issues did arrive we worked as a team to use our combined knowledge to fix the issues, rather than struggling alone. Additionally, we were more proactive this week and got an earlier start on the project. This way, when we arrived at thursdays lab, we already had real issues to resolve, and we were able to use that time, and the TAâ€™s help more effectively. Lastly we set clear deadlines for handoff which reduced the amount of blockers we encountered. It was great to see the team form a more cohesive bond throughout the class, at this point we are very effective and more than the sum of our equal parts!
